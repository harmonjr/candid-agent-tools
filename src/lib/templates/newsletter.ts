    content: `# Monthly Newsletter — [MONTH YEAR]

**SUBJECT LINE**
[Formula: [Number or Question] + [Specific Topic] + [for Who]]
Examples:
- "3 things changing in [MARKET] this month (and what they mean for you)"
- "What [MONTH]'s numbers actually tell us about [MARKET]"
- "The question every [BUYER/SELLER] should ask right now"

**OPENING HOOK (2-3 sentences)**
[Start with something real — a conversation you had, a trend you noticed, a question a client asked. NOT "Happy [Month]! I hope this finds you well!"]

Example: "A client asked me last week: 'Should I wait until spring to list?' I gave her an honest answer, and I want to share the same thinking with you."

**ONE EDUCATIONAL INSIGHT (150-200 words)**
[Pick ONE topic and go deep. This is the value. Ideas:]
- A common mistake you've seen recently
- A market trend explained honestly
- A piece of advice you wish more people heard
- A myth you'd like to debunk

Keep it conversational. Write like you're explaining this to a friend over coffee.

**ONE LOCAL UPDATE (100-150 words)**
[Quick market snapshot — 3-4 key numbers with plain-language interpretation. See the Market Update template for structure.]

**SIGN-OFF**
[Personal, warm, brief. Include your name and ONE way to reach you.]

Example: "If any of this raised a question, reply to this email. I read every one. — [YOUR NAME]"

**GROWTH GUIDANCE**
- Consistency > frequency. Monthly is enough.
- Every email should pass the test: "Would I open this if I weren't in real estate?"
- Add a subscriber by asking one person per week: "I write a monthly email about [MARKET]. No spam, just honest market info. Want in?"
- No purchased lists. No spam. No "drip campaigns" that feel like robots wrote them.`,
