    content: `# First-Time Buyer Series — Part 1: What You Can Actually Afford

*This is Part 1 of a 4-part series for first-time homebuyers. Written to educate, not to sell.*

**KEY POINTS**
- Pre-approval is a ceiling, not a target. Lenders calculate what you CAN borrow, not what you SHOULD.
- Your real budget = monthly income minus actual living expenses minus savings goals. What's left is your housing number.
- Include ALL housing costs: mortgage, taxes, insurance, maintenance (budget 1% of home value annually), HOA, utilities.
- Build in a margin — at least $200-400/month of breathing room for life's surprises.

**COMMON MISTAKES**
- House-shopping at the top of your pre-approval range
- Forgetting that furniture, moving costs, and first-year repairs add up fast ($5,000-$15,000 is normal)
- Comparing your budget to what friends or social media say you "should" be able to afford
- Depleting your emergency fund for the down payment

**THE CANDID AGENT PHILOSOPHY**
The best first home is one that makes your life better, not harder. If a home purchase means you can't save, can't travel, can't handle a car repair — it's too much house. There's no shame in buying below your maximum. That's not settling. That's wisdom.

    content: `# First-Time Buyer Series — Part 2: The Search Process (Patience > Panic)

*Part 2 of 4. The search is where most first-time buyers either find their footing or lose their minds.*

**KEY POINTS**
- Define your must-haves vs. nice-to-haves BEFORE you start looking. Write them down.
- Expect to see 8-15 homes before making an offer. Some buyers see fewer, some more. Both are normal.
- Online photos lie (in both directions). That "ugly" listing might be perfect in person. That "stunning" listing might be all filters.
- Visit neighborhoods at different times: morning commute, evening, weekend. Drive the actual commute to work.

**COMMON MISTAKES**
- Falling in love with the first house and refusing to see alternatives
- Searching outside your budget range ("just to see what's out there" — this always ends in disappointment)
- Making decisions based on cosmetics (paint and fixtures are cheap) instead of structure (foundation and location are forever)
- Panic-bidding because someone told you "the market is crazy"

**THE CANDID AGENT PHILOSOPHY**
The search should be exciting, not exhausting. If you feel rushed, pressured, or overwhelmed, pause. The right house will not be the only right house. Markets have inventory cycles. New listings appear every week. Patience is not a risk — panic is.

    content: `# First-Time Buyer Series — Part 3: Under Contract (What to Expect)

*Part 3 of 4. Your offer was accepted. Now the real process begins — and it's more manageable than you think.*

**KEY POINTS**
- The timeline from accepted offer to closing is typically 30-45 days. Your lender and title company drive the pace.
- Major milestones: inspection (days 7-10), appraisal (days 14-21), clear to close (days 25-35), closing day.
- You'll be asked for documentation repeatedly. This is normal — lenders are thorough. Keep pay stubs, bank statements, and tax returns accessible.
- Don't make major financial changes during this period: no new credit cards, no large purchases, no job changes.

**COMMON MISTAKES**
- Buying furniture or appliances on credit before closing (this can kill your loan approval)
- Skipping the inspection to "save money" or "be competitive" — this is the worst possible shortcut
- Not reading what you're signing — ask questions about anything you don't understand
- Assuming the process will be smooth — minor hiccups are normal. A delayed appraisal is not a disaster.

**THE CANDID AGENT PHILOSOPHY**
The under-contract period feels like a lot of waiting. That's normal. Your agent should be communicating proactively — if you're wondering what's happening, something's wrong with the communication, not the transaction. Ask. A good agent welcomes questions.

    description: 'The first 90 days of homeownership — what nobody tells you.',
    content: `# First-Time Buyer Series — Part 4: After You Close (The First 90 Days)

*Part 4 of 4. Congratulations, you own a home. Here's what the first 90 days actually look like.*

**KEY POINTS**
- **Days 1-7:** Change the locks, locate your main water shut-off and electrical panel, test all smoke/CO detectors.
- **Days 7-30:** Set up utilities in your name, file your homestead exemption (property tax benefit), update your address everywhere.
- **Days 30-60:** Start a home maintenance calendar. Schedule HVAC service, check the water heater, clean gutters if it's fall.
- **Days 60-90:** Build your "home emergency fund" — separate from your regular emergency fund. Target: $2,000-$5,000.

**COMMON MISTAKES**
- Renovating everything immediately — live in the house first. After 3-6 months, you'll know what actually needs changing.
- Ignoring small issues that become big issues (a small leak ignored for 6 months becomes a $5,000 repair)
- Not meeting your neighbors — they're your first line of defense and your best source of local information
- Comparing your house to Instagram — your first home is a starting point, not a magazine cover

**THE CANDID AGENT PHILOSOPHY**
Homeownership is a long game. The first 90 days set the tone. Build habits now — maintenance calendar, emergency fund, slow improvements — and your home will serve you well for years. The agents who help you after closing are the ones worth referring.
