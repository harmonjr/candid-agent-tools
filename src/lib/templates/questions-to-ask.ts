    content: `# Questions to Ask Before You Buy a Home

*Share these with your clients to help them think clearly — before emotion takes over.*

**1. What can I actually afford each month — not just qualify for?**
Why it matters: Pre-approval tells you the maximum. Your budget should be based on your life, not a ratio.

**2. What does my life look like in 3-5 years?**
Why it matters: A home is a commitment. Job changes, family plans, and lifestyle shifts all affect whether this purchase will serve you well.

**3. What are the TOTAL monthly costs — not just the mortgage?**
Why it matters: Taxes, insurance, HOA, maintenance, and utilities can add 30-50% on top of your mortgage payment.

**4. What am I willing to compromise on, and what's non-negotiable?**
Why it matters: Every buyer has a budget. Knowing your priorities in advance prevents emotional overspending on features that don't matter to you.

**5. Have I researched this neighborhood at different times of day?**
Why it matters: A street that's quiet on Saturday morning might be a highway shortcut at 5 PM. Visit at least twice, at different times.

**6. What's the worst-case scenario, and can I handle it?**
Why it matters: Job loss, rate increases, major repairs. If the worst case would be catastrophic, the purchase might be over-leveraged.

**7. Am I being pressured to move faster than I'm comfortable?**
Why it matters: Urgency is a sales tactic, not a strategy. A good agent helps you move at a pace that lets you make clear decisions.

*Share these with your clients to help them think clearly — before the sign goes in the yard.*

**1. What will I net after commissions, repairs, and closing costs?**
Why it matters: The sale price isn't your profit. Subtract commissions (~5-6%), closing costs (~1-2%), and any repairs or concessions. That's your real number.

**2. Where am I going next, and what does that cost?**
Why it matters: Selling into the same market you're buying in can be a wash. Know your next move before you list.

**3. What's my home actually worth — based on data, not feelings?**
Why it matters: Overpricing costs you time and often money. The market sets the price, not your renovation budget or Zillow estimate.

**4. What repairs will buyers and inspectors flag?**
Why it matters: You can fix them now (on your terms, at your price) or negotiate them later (on the buyer's terms, at their price). Proactive is almost always cheaper.

**5. Am I emotionally ready for strangers to critique my home?**
Why it matters: Buyers will find flaws. Inspectors will find more. Feedback can be blunt. This is normal — it's not personal.

**6. What's my timeline, and how flexible am I?**
Why it matters: Flexibility is leverage. If you must sell by a date, your negotiation power decreases. Plan ahead.

    content: `# Questions to Ask Before You Refinance

*Share these with past clients and your network — refinancing isn't always the win it's sold as.*

**1. What's my break-even point?**
Why it matters: Refinancing costs $3,000-$6,000+. Divide that by your monthly savings to find how many months until you actually benefit. If you might move before then, refinancing costs you money.

**2. Am I extending my loan timeline?**
Why it matters: Refinancing a 30-year mortgage after 5 years into another 30-year means 35 total years of payments. A lower payment isn't savings if it adds years of interest.

**3. Is my goal lower payments, less total interest, or cash out?**
Why it matters: These are different goals with different strategies. A lower rate doesn't help if you extend the term. Cash-out refi means borrowing against your home equity.

**4. What's my current rate vs. the new rate — and is the gap meaningful?**
Why it matters: A 0.25% difference on a $250K loan saves ~$35/month. After closing costs, that might take 10+ years to break even. The gap needs to be significant.

**5. Am I being sold a refinance, or is it genuinely in my interest?**
Why it matters: Mortgage companies profit from refinancing. A good advisor explains the math honestly, including scenarios where refinancing doesn't make sense.
